# Simpson Classifier  
My little project for Chapter 2 of the book [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://www.amazon.de/Deep-Learning-Coders-Fastai-Pytorch/dp/1492045527) the code is based on the code in the book and the exampels from [fastai](http://docs.fast.ai/).

Clicking the button below, will startup a server and run the application. After this is done you can test out the Simpson Classifier. *This can take up to five minutes!*
